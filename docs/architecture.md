# MarkdownGlance architecture

## Boundaries

`adapter` translates Sublime commands and events into use cases. `application`
owns sessions, scheduling and orchestration through ports. `domain`, `renderer`
and `assets` are independently testable Python. `presentation` owns native
surfaces and layout bookkeeping.

The selected backend is a read-only scratch `View` containing one block
`Phantom`. Heading position ratios provide programmatic TOC navigation. Layout
ownership is fingerprinted; restoration occurs only for an empty, unchanged,
plugin-created group after its last holder closes.

A second, independent surface is the source outline: `renderer/outline.py`
scans raw Markdown for ATX and setext headings by line, and
`application/outline.py` owns one outline per source buffer, keyed on
`(window, buffer)`, reaching the host only through injected read-text,
read-caret and reveal-line callables. It shares the backend, the layout owner
and the stylesheet with the preview, and nothing else: no render, no assets, no
generations. `SessionManager.reconcile` asks `foreign_surface` before closing an
owned surface it does not recognise, which is how outline surfaces survive a
sweep run for previews.

## Reliability and safety

Each immutable `RenderRequest` contains a generation. A session has at most one
render in flight; edits coalesce and the newest requested generation dispatches
immediately after completion. Results return to the UI thread and are applied
only to a live session at its current generation.

Asset fetching uses a separate four-worker executor, a 64 MiB in-memory LRU,
30-second negative caching, HTTPS by default, at most five redirects, a 15-second
timeout, 10 MiB response limit, and 4096 px dimension limit. Only
`AssetKey.safe_label` is diagnostic-safe; Mermaid locators are never logged.

Decision details and experiment evidence are in the repository-level
`docs/adr/` directory.
